virtuelium
==========

Virtuelium is a full-spectral rendering engine. It is based on an university project (Ecole Centrale Paris / Ecole des Mines). We need you in order to improve the architecture of the code, make it more flexible, and develop new technologies (rendering engines, acceleration structures, physical models and more..). Virtuelium is also involved in a large variety of simulation projects, including some nice stuff in Cultural Heritage. Everyone is welcomed.
